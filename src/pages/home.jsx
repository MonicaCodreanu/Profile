            <p>My career has taken me on an exciting journeyâ€”from web design and sales engineering to software release management and IT consulting.

            <p>
              Iâ€™ve always been drawn to learning and innovation. Moving to Sweden in 2019 was not only a personal adventure but also an opportunity to embrace new skills and perspectives. I took on the challenge of learning Swedish (and Iâ€™m getting pretty good at it!) while also expanding my knowledge in web development, customer relations, and IT support.
